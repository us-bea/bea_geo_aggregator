# Support

This page explains where to get help with this project. If you suspect a bug (or wanted feature) with the library, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The first step is see if available resources answer your question. See our work paper on the methodology. You can also search our Issues (including those "closed").

If none of that answers our question you can post a question in on our Discussions forum. It is very helpful to put in extra effort so that someone not familiar with your problem can understand your issue.

You may also provide feedback reis@bea.gov (feedback and code can be provided together as an .ipynb file, or can be provided separately, in the formats of your preference).
